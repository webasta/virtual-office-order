<h1>WordPress Custom Plugin Information</h1>
<p>Here we are just showing an example of a secondary WP Admin page for hte plugin that is accessed from the left admin navigation.</p>

<p>The second sub menu item could just link to a function as well that does some logic and redirects to the main settings page of the plugin as well. If I have time I may add a third sub menu item that does that.</p>
